\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I thank Prof. Dr. Roger Wattenhofer for admitting me to his group and allowing me to work almost entirely on Bitcoin. When I applied to join his group, I was not his typical Ph.D candidate; but Roger took a chance on me and I am grateful for that. Roger also gave me a small platform as the coordinator of blockchain-research group meetings, and helped me expand my research horizons. Roger also understands the libertarian appeal of Bitcoin - which mattered the most to me. In Roger, I found a kindred spirit. 

I thank Prof. Dr. Majid Khabbazian for collaborating with me on 3 of my papers. Majid is brimming with ideas, and it was a privilege to be a part of his thinking process once in a while.

I thank my ``students''. Torgin, for official and unofficial discussions on blockchains. Daniel, for reversing roles and being my manager and hooking me on to trail running. 

I thank DISCO members and alumni.\textit{@snyke}, who told me back in 2014 that he was doing a Ph.D on Bitcoin with Roger and made me go ``hmm...''. Darya, for being my first office-mate and showing me the ropes here at ETH. Roland, for helping me with the scariest speech of my life. Zeta, for showing me how academic research is done. Ard, for answering all my Zero Knowledge questions patiently. Yann, for being the backstop that saved my a** more than once. Kobi, for asking the provocative questions. And the rest of the DISCO group, for graciously accepting my early-lunch shenanigans and still including me in other activities.

I thank folks at Bitcoin Suisse, who were gracious hosts during my internship: esp. Robin and Michael. Not to mention Arthur, who surprised me more than once.

I thank my parents - Anuradha and Bhaskara Rao; and my sister - Banumathy. They made me curious about how the world works and equipped me with tools to explore it. 

This Ph.D would not have been possible if it weren't for my wife Kriti Puniyani. She is my best friend, partner, and sounding-board. I thank her for helping me keep it real.

Finally, I thank Satoshi Nakamoto and the cypherpunks who came before and after Satoshi. I thank them for giving me a cause \cite{bitcoin_whitepaper} to get behind.
